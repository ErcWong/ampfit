AMPFit is not your typical gym. In society's view, a typical gym would have equipment such as treadmill, elliptical and exercise bikes. However, at AMPFit, these machines are nowhere to be seen. The equipment available at AMPFit are squat racks, barbells and kettle bells. At first, these exercising tools might be a bit intimidating because it is not something we were exposed to during our high school stages of life. Or, if someone, at a typical gym was using a barbell, they would be lifting a lot of weight. At AMPFit, we are taught to maintain proper form and posture so that we can use these fitness tools to help us achieve or goals. With correct techniques we can build on them and slowly increase our ability to lift much more. I am very happy with my progress at AMPFit. Not only is this a gym, but this is a community where everyone knows everyone and everyone is encouraging each other to continuously making progress. Owen's goals is for us to utilize all the muscles in our bodies to achieve goals that are unimaginable, yet.
