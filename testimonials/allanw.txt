My fitness journey has come with many twists and turns. Before AMPFit, my lifts weren't at the level that I wanted. Because of this, I started talking to Owen about helping me increase my strength. He put on a strength program to improve my lifts, by working on my foundation and basics. At first I didn't know what to expect, and the journey to get there wasn't easy. But the end result was many new personal records. Sometimes all you really need is to go back to the basics. Be happy with your progress, no matter how small, because it is the small gains that will lead to big things in the long run. Thank Owen for your help, coaching, and being a great friend. In 2015, I hope for more PR's, and awesome lifting to come. Thank AMPFit, I will be always be making progress every time I come.
