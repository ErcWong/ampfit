When I was signing up for personal training earlier this year, I asked for a trainer that was strict enough to discipline me as well as fun enough for me to not want to quit. Immediately, the front desk worker suggested Owen, assuring me that he was the right one for me. Speaking from having trained with more than one fitness trainer, Owen is, without a doubt the best trainer I've had. I've always been reluctant to train with weights mainly because I thought using weights meant getting "big". Owen was extremely patient with me as he reassured me numerous times by explaining the benefits of using weights. He is extremely knowledgeable, as well as super motivating. He has taught me the proper techniques of squats, deadlifts, kettle bell swings, and so much more, all of which I've learned to incorporate into my daily workouts till this day. I would definitely recommend Owen as an amazing trainer and you won't regret your decision!
