When I first started with AMP, I noticed a great difference in the training with Owen than when I just went to a gym on my own. Not only is Owen there to teach all the proper techniques of weight training, he's always there to help you improve. I've learned so many ways of working out - without all those machines you see at the gym. I've always been a person that doubted myself in doing certain things but Owen always encourages and pushes you just enough while also listening to any concerns or answering any questions you may have. The atmosphere at AMP is also very different from a regular gym. Everyone is very friendly and you get to know one another. AMP is a very good gym for anyone in any fitness level because he is able to assess what needs to be worked on in any level and if you are looking for a trainer that is motivating, patient and most importantly knows his stuff, this is for you.
