Having been a client of Owen's for over 5 years, I can honestly say that he is amazing at what he does. What I admire about Owen the most as a trainer is that he is so invested in his work and his students - he genuinely wants to see us make progress and this is reflected in his commitment to his work and his approach to training. Over the years, I have watched AMPfit grow into a very unique fitness environment that goes above and beyond what I have seen at any other gym. Not only do you get Owen as an extremely knowledgeable, qualified and committed trainer, but you also become a part of a community of students who encourage and support each other's fitness goals.
