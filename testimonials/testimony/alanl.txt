I've been at AMP for over a year now and I can say that I've made a 
lot of progress in terms of my overall strength and fitness. Starting out 
I was not able to lift heavy weights but with a workout plan tailored to 
my goals, I've been able to set new personal records for weightlifting 
and will look to compete in the future.
