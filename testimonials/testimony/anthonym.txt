Owen is a passionate, knowledgeable, and technical trainer. I had severe back problems 
for 3 years, being refined to the couch and not being able to sit or walk properly. 
I tried everything but it wasn't until I started training at AMPFit that i realized my 
core deficiencies were leading to recurring back pain. I didn't really know how to 
activate my core but now I know how important it is to a strong and functional 
healthy body. Thank you Owen!
