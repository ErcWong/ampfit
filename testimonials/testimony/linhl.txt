In a word, AMPfit is wonderful.

The facility and equipment are of extremely high quality, and can serve to fullfill any fitness goal that you may have. But what separates AMPfit from the rest is its encouraging and fun atmosphere. Everyone is open and friendly, and will immediately make you feel welcomed and included in a big AMPfit family, regardless of gender, age, race, preferences, or level of fitness!

Owen embodies the namesake of the gym itself; he is always striving to make progress in his own fitness and exercise knowledge and this is easily seen with his ever-evolving practices and equipment at AMPfit. The highest compliment I can pay him is that he is, through and through, a professional in his field.

So if you're wondering if you should come here, let me make your decision for you, and just do it! You'll get more than toned abs if you do :D
