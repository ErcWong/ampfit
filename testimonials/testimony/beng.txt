AMPfit is a fun and friendly training environment for anyone. But don't be mistaken,
Owen will push you to your limits and to blood, sweat and sometimes tears. 
In all seriousness, I have been training at AMPfit for a year and a half, and with the guidance of Owen 
I have made tremendous progress in strength and overall fitness. Owen is a very knowledgeable
and motivational trainer who has instilled me with a better knowledge in lifting (i.e. squats, deadlifts, bench, etc.) 
confidence and powerful glutes. His programs are tough but fun and adaptable to fit any fitness goals.
I would recommend anyone who is new or experienced with lifting to try AMPfit #noragrets.
