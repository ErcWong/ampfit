Working in the healthcare industry I’ve witnessed numerous collegues injure their bodies while tending to the sick. My original goal of joining AMPFit was to simply avoid this by developing a stronger core and body. Not only has my experience at Ampfit achieved this, I’ve begun to set more specific goals in my strength training and am always learning something new. I really appreciate Owen’s emphasis on proper lifting technique and engaging all muscle groups for a full body work out each time. Most importantly, I've been able to take the skills I’ve learned from AMPFitand apply them to my daily work environment and active lifestyle. My advice to anyone who is on the fence about joining is to try it, be patient, and stay consistent. You will discover the benefits are so empowering and priceless. To those who have a background in lifting, Owen has great equipment! And an ever growing knowledge base that might just help you break your next PR. Thank you AMPFit for your time and faith in me!
