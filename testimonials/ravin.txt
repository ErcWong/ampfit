As someone who was extremely new to working out and getting into shape, I can honestly say that Owen is a great motivator and instructor. Owen was really accommodating to the fact that I was a beginner and as he got to know me, he created workouts that were realistic and doable for me. He has a positive influence on my attitude towards exercise and constantly comes up with new methods to keep me motivated. He's always willing to answer questions and is extremely knowledgeable about the work that he does so his answers are well informed and helpful. I would recommend Owen to anyone who is wanting to get in shape regardless of their fitness level.
