Before I joined AMPFIT, I've never heard of a "kettlebell" and never
thought I would be into weight training. I've tried many different
things from yoga to kickboxing to bootcamp type classes but they never
kept my interest for long. Then I joined AMPFIT, which turned out to
be more than just a gym but a community as well. I've made many
friends through AMP and new members are always welcomed with a smile
by existing members.

It doesn't matter if you're a complete work out newbie or on your way
to weightlifting competitions, Owen is able to assess your fitness
level and adapt your workout program specifically to your goals. Even
after 3 years at AMP, I'm still motivated, learning and "always making
progress" to improve my form and technique to achieve new goals.

My reasons you should join AMP:

* Learn a good set of foundation movements (or even if you've been working out for a while, Owen is a technique master and would have great feedback to take you to the next level)
* Work with an attentive trainer who can teach you proper technique, adapt to your needs and help you meet your goals
* Meet great people, rather than just clocking in and out at a corporate gym, come make some friends!
