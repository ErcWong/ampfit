Owen is a great trainer and AMPFit is a great place to be. I've learned things training here I didn't know before and definitely improved on things I could do before. It's rare to work out somewhere where you can have a balance of being challenged physically and also have positive influences from the people around you. Everyone at AMP feels like family. It's easy to walk in the door and just forget about whatever else is going on elsewhere. I don't think I've ever been at a gym where I have the perfect balance in exercise along with personal happiness until I came here.
