                <p class="lead">Proper Movement is crucial for injury prevention and safe and effective strength training. At <span class="amp">AMPFit</span>,
                    you must learn how to move, you must earn a proper foundation of movement. This principle applies through
                    all domains of training and more importantly, all aspects of life.</p>
                <p class="lead">When you have achieved a proper foundation of movement, the next step is improving your strength. A proper
                    base of strength is now emphasized because it will aid you in reaching your individual goals. This will
                    also help your body in preventing injuries.

                    I started as a martial artist who wanted to improve my skills and prevent injury. For this purpose, I decided to pursue basic
                    strength training. I discovered that this was not only beneficial for athletes, but for the general population
                    as well. This is what sparked my passion for teaching <b>Movement</b> and <b>Strength</b>.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">I started working in commercial gyms for a number of years. There were a few things that I would always see:
                    People that didn't respect the equipment, people that were on the treadmill aimlessly for hours on end,
                    people that were stuck lifting the same weight for ages and with horrible, horrible form. In a commerical
                    gym, these types of things are unavoidable.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <p class="lead">
                    These are the reasons why I wanted to open an <span class="amp">AMPFit</span> facility. <span class="amp">AMPFit</span>
                    was created to avoid these clich&eacute;s and produce a higher standard of training.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    <span class="ampfit">AMPFit</span> is not a commercial gym; I designed this place to be a quality training
                    facility. We do not accept drop-ins or provide regular gym memberships, because all members are students.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    All students must learn basic movement patterns and learn how to lift properly and effectively. My goal is to teach the necessary
                    tools to ensure every one of my students is <span class="amp">Always
