											I started as a martial artist who wanted to improve my skills
											and prevent injury. For this purpose, I decided to pursue
											basic strength training. I discovered that this was not only
											beneficial for athletes, but for the general population as
											well. This is what sparked my passion for teaching <b>Movement</b>
											and <b>Strength</b>.
										</p>
										<p class="text">I started working in commercial gyms for a
											number of years. There were a few things that I would always
											see: People that didn't respect the equipment, people that
											were on the treadmill aimlessly for hours on end, people that
											were stuck lifting the same weight for ages and with
											horrible, horrible form. In a commerical gym, these types of
											things are unavoidable.</p>

											These are the reasons why I wanted to open an <span
												class="ampfit">AMPFit</span> facility. <span class="ampfit">AMPFit</span>
											was created to avoid these clich&eacute;s and produce a
											higher standard of training.
										</p>
										<p class="text">
											<span class="ampfit">AMPFit</span> is not a commercial gym; I
											designed this place to be a quality training facility. We do
											not accept drop-ins or provide regular gym memberships,
											because all members are students.
										</p>
										<p class="text">
											All students must learn basic movement patterns and learn how
											to lift properly and effectively. My goal is to teach the
											necessary tools to ensure every one of my students is <span
