            <p>
                At AMPFit, we utilize the kettlebell as the introductory tool to teach the basics of movement and
                lifting. <br><br>
                We teach StrongFirst or “hard-style” kettlebell training which is used to develop a great base of
                strength, power, and endurance. <br><br>
                If you have a goal of leaning out, slimming down or just want a quick and effective training session,
                give the kettlebell a try!

            <p>
                The barbell is a great tool for building strength and muscle mass. <br><br>
                As always, it starts with the basics. AMPFit teaches these four basic barbell lifts to start: the
                Military Press, the Squat, the Bench Press and the Deadlift.
