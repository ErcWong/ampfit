      <h2>Kettlebell</h2>
      <p>At AMPFit, we utilize the kettlebell as the main introductory tool to teach the basics 
		of movement and lifting. We teach StrongFirst or 'hard-style' kettlebell training which 
		can be used to develop a great base of movement, power, and endurance. If you have a 
		goal of leaning out, slimming down or just want a quick and effective workout, give the kettlebell a try!</p>
