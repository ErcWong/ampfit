                Once you’ve gotten into the groove of things at AMP Group Training, you will have learned a variety of
                skills and exercises. Sweat Saturday is the day to put your training to the test. It’s also a great time
                to train with your fellow classmates and perhaps meet some new ones.<br>
                <br> You must be approved and prepared before joining Sweat Saturdays. If one of your main goals is
                to attend, prioritize staying consistent in AMP Group Training. When you are ready, you will be
                informed.<br>
                <br> Sweat Saturday is not for everyone. If Sweat Saturday does not fit your individual goals, it
                is highly recommended that you do not participate. Sweat Saturday is included with your AMP Group
                Training registration. It is held every Saturday starting at 1:30pm sharp, the gym is open beforehand so
                you may properly prepare and warm–up. Please arrive a minimum of 15 minutes prior to start time to get
                organized.
