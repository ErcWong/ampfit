                Once you’ve gotten into the groove of things at AMPFit Group Training, you will have learned a variety
                of skills and exercises. Sweat Saturday is the day to put your training to the test. It’s also a great
                time to train with your fellow classmates and perhaps meet some new ones.<br>
                <br> You must be approved and prepared before joining Sweat Saturdays. If one of your main goals is to
                attend, prioritize staying consistent in AMPFit Group Training. When you are ready, you will be
                informed and granted access to join the group. Sweat Saturday is not for everyone. If Sweat Saturday
                does not fit your individual goals, we do not recommend that you participate.<br>
                <br> Sweat Saturday is included with your Group Training registration. Please arrive a minimum of 15
                minutes prior to start time so you may properly warm–up, prepare and get organized.
