        <div class="col-md-12">After completing AMP: Lifting Principles, you will have the prerequisite knowledge
            to continue training safely and effectively. AMP Group Training is your next step. While you will constantly
            strive to improve your basics, it is now time to focus more on your goals. There are an endless amount of
            different training options at your disposal. This may lead to confusion, making training seem more
            complicated than it needs to be. Resolve your dilemma by asking yourself: “What is my purpose?” Can’t quite
            decide? Take a look at What We Teach, and have a chat with us. Don’t worry, as always, we’re here to help.</div>
