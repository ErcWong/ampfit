        “In competitive Olympic Weightlifting, there are two lifts contested – the Snatch, 
        and the Clean & Jerk. Each athlete has three attempts at each lift, and the sum of their 
        best Snatch and best Clean & Jerk is their Total. The goal is to execute a proper lift 
        with as heavy a weight as possible. If there is a tie, the lifter with the lightest 
        bodyweight is given a higher ranking.” – BC Weightlifting Association
