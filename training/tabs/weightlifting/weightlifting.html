		    and the Clean & Jerk. Each athlete has three attempts at each lift, and the sum of their 
		    best Snatch and best Clean & Jerk is their Total. The goal is to execute a proper lift 
		    with as heavy a weight as possible. If there is a tie, the lifter with the lightest 
		    bodyweight is given a higher ranking." - </i>
